基于无人机的光伏面板故障检测

It is slightly simplified implementation of Convolutional Neural Networks for Image Classification
Image Classification via CNN neural network implemented in tensorflow

Key Requirements: Python 3.5.3 Tensorflow 1.13.1

Suggestion: Better to download Anaconda as it will take care of most of the other packages and easier to setup a virtual workspace to work with multiple versions of key packages like python, tensorflow etc.
